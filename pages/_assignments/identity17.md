Read through your entire journal and think about your experiences in the class.

Think about your past self:
- What do you wish you knew on the first day of class? 
- What advice would you give to yourself then?

Now think about your future self:
- What do you hope your future self won’t forget?
- What do you hope you’ll continue to hold yourself accountable to?
