## Journal Setup
1. Create a Google Document and title in the following way: “LASTNAME_FIRSTINITIAL_IDJ” (EX: “MELO_N_IDJ”)
  - This whole doc is your journal– a place to keep all entries together. 
  - You’ll be submitting **individual entries** through Canvas
2. Share Google Doc with profs: 
  - vcchavez@u.northwestern.edu
  - melon@u.northwestern.edu

Remember: Every time you make an entry, **you must submit the text on Canvas.**


## Let’s do the first entry!
Share your thoughts on the following:

- Why are you taking this course?
- How would you characterize your own relationship with technology?
- What do you need to thrive in this course (personally, intellectually, and socially)?
- What can you offer members of the course to thrive together (kind words, physical help, intellectual collaboration, and so on)?
- Anything else you think we should know!

Remember: **Submit your *entry text* on Canvas.**
