Remember: Every time you make an entry, **you must submit the text on Canvas.**


## Letâ€™s do the first entry!
Share your thoughts on the following:

- Why are you taking this course?
- What do you need to thrive in this course (personally, intellectually, and socially)?
- What can you offer members of the course to thrive together (kind words, physical help, intellectual collaboration, and so on)?
- Anything else you think we should know!

Remember: **Submit your *entry text* on Canvas.**
