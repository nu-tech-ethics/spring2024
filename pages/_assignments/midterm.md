## Instructions
Develop a conceptual framework that draws on the readings as well as your identity to articulate your unique perspective on a **specific technology**. That is, 
1. you will choose a technology that you would like to analyze, 
2. you will develop a framework based on theoretical arguments from **at least 3 of the readings** covered thus far _and_ **your own personal identity and experience** in the world, 
3. you will apply your framework to analyze that technology. 

### Format
Your analysis can take the format of:
- A paper: 5-6 page (graduate credit: 7-9 page) double spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. Must include citations of any quotes/ideas used and bibliography (in addition to page count).
- OR a presentation: 12-15 minute (graduate credit: 18-20 minute) presentation recording. Must include citations of any quotes/ideas used from readings and bibliography (can be a slide or separate attachment).

#### Graduate Credit Students
In addition to the extended paper/presentation format, graduate credit students must ALSO include a section historicizing some component of your selected technology. Some questions to think about as you develop this section: 
- When was the technology developed? What was happening in the world during that time?
- Who conceptualized the technology and why? What issue in the world, if any, was it in response to?
- Who was part of the design process and who wasn't? Why was that the case during that time?
- How has the technology been utilized over time, and by whom? Why?
- What other historical ideas/moments is this related to?

### Citations
Follow [APA guidelines](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa6_style/index.html) for formatting and references:
- Include an [APA style bibliography](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html) at end of writeup or as slide at end of video
- Written formats should use:
  - [In-text citations](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html) 
- Video formats should use:
  - verbal or textual cues (i.e., “According to Winner in ‘Do Artifacts have Politics…” while speaking
  - [In-text citations](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html) when using slides
  - video annotations ([like this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3rS7I6Xyz8))

## Tips and Examples

Ultimately, your conceptual framework should be useful, and productive. You will draw upon it to conduct a sociopolitical analysis of your chosen technology. Your analysis will be designed to shed light on questions such as: 
- What values do this technology reflect, embrace, reject, or encourage? 
- Who is affected by its design? How was its design affected by society? 
- Who reaps the benefits, and who suffers the costs of its creation and use? 

Check out the rubric below to see exactly what criteria we'll be grading on!

Examples ([published in BreakPoint Journal!](https://tree-in-education.github.io/BreakPointNU/index.html)):
- Blue Emergency Lights: An Investment in White Supremacist Surveillance on College Campuses
  - "I maintain there is an alternative intention; blue emergency lights are a measure of surveillance to increase the perceived safety of students through the exile, policing, and surveillance of Black and brown people."
- E-Scooters in Chicago: A Cautionary Tale e-scooters
  - "This paper seeks to understand the values and attitudes that have shaped the implementation of e-scooter technology in Chicago, and their subsequent impact on society. In the process, we will also examine the interplay of public policy and technological advancement, and the politics embedded in society’s interaction with technology."

## Rubric

|  | Full <br> (Grade: A-B) | Partial <br>  (Grade: B-C) | Needs work <br> (Grade: C or lower) |  |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Structure, clarity, citations** | Easy to follow line of analysis through the paper. Well Organized. APA Formatting. Citations. | Needs additional clarity on line of analysis through the paper. Semi Organized. Incomplete APA Formatting. Incomplete citations. | Minimal to no line of analysis through the paper. Not Organized. Lacks APA Formatting. Lacks citations. |  |
| **Conceptual Framework** | Thoughtful integration of multiple theoretical perspectives drawing on at least 3 constructs from readings covered so far; clear articulation of how personal experience/identity informs conceptual framework; makes visible how conceptual framework will be useful for the specific purposes of the ethical analysis centered in paper. | Includes references to theoretical constructs and/or personal experience/identity, but integration is unclear or incoherent; link to analysis is partial or incomplete. | Does not integrate multiple theoretical perspectives using readings; fails to incorporate personal experience/identity in framework; unclear how framework is linked to analysis. |  |
| **Analysis** | Draws clear connections to conceptual framework with references to readings as appropriate. Considers multiple perspectives and includes analysis which addresses implications of technology and how societal conditions shaped design and intent of technology. | Makes undertheorized connections to conceptual framework with references to readings as appropriate. Considers one perspective and lacks analysis that addresses both implications of technology and how societal conditions shaped design and intent of technology. | No clear connections to conceptual framework. Does not consider perspectives or include analysis that addresses implications of technology and how societal conditions shaped design and intent of technology. |  |
