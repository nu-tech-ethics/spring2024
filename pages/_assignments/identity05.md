In response to CRT, some people would say “the past is in the past.” In fact, many lawmakers today are challenging critical race theorizing:
> …many people are pushing a different vision of America that is grounded in hierarchies based on collective social and political identities rather than in the inherent and equal dignity of every person as an individual. This ideology is rooted in the pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country; that some people, simply on account of their race or sex, are oppressors; and that racial and sexual identities are more important than our common status as human beings and Americans. (Exec. Order 13950, 2020)
