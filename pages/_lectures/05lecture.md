    notes: "We recognize not everyone may have access to Hulu and as such have <a href='https://canvas.northwestern.edu/files/18867997/'>uploaded a version to Canvas</a>. Also, this could be a great opportunity to come together (covid-safely, of course) with your learning pods and watch together in person!"
